# ReactApp
A Basic Unfinished React App


Getting started:
Go into the source directory of this project in terminal and run 'npm start' making sure you have npm installed. You should be redirected to localhost:3000 where you will see the project.



File structure:
  src:
    |- WelcomePage    (login page)
    |- Register       (sign up page)
    |- NewTravelPage  (plan new travel)
    |- Planning       (add events to travel)
    |- Reference      (reference new travel)
    |- History        (past travel)
    |- Common         (common files between pages)
    



Future work:
      - add backend via redux or nodejs
      - add navigation via router
      - connect frontend and backend
